Whenever we have an event, we have event.eventPhase :
1 = Capturing 
2 = Target  (level of object that had the event occur)
3 = Bubbling
0 = None (no event currently occuring)

Every element above the clicked(targeted) element is notified during the Capture phase, 

    Capture Phase: Window > Document > html > body > table > tbody > tr > tbody

    Target Phase: element that had the event occur 

    Bubbling Phase: Every element above is again notified that this element had an event occur to it 

You can listen in on the capture or bubbling phase on the parent components 
usCapture(paramater)
Third argument in addEventListener is a boolean 
    True = Capture Phase 
    False = Bubbling Phase

Determines if things should happend before or after (capture or bubble phase)

e.target.id VS this.id 

e.target will always refer to which element is the target (clicked)(element on which the event happened)
this refers to the element being propogated through

- Stop Propagation 

event.stopPropagation();

In Capture Phase (True):
Parent element or highest element is notified but then nothing else happens 
because e.stopPropagation() stops the propagation from occuring further 

In Bubbling Phase (False):
Only the target element is notified none of the parents
because e.stopPropogation() stops the bubbling up to the parents
